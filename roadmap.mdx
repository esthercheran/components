# Roadmap

## Looking for support with

- CSS TOKENS: migrating design tokens to css vars instead of scss vars (best practices for multi brand/theme and light/dark style)
- Grid system: ideally we want to support a column grid as well as grid that wraps components
- Improve integration between style dictionary and figma
- Design token linter to verify design files in figma through plugin / CLI before dev hand-off
- Design token inspector to easily inspect components and extract tokens (also for components imported from a library)
