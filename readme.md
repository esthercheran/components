# Substrate Design System - Stencil Web Component Library

This repository contains only the web component library. Check out our [Substrate DS Docs](https://docs.nextds.design) or the [Substrate DS StoryBook](https://sb.nextds.design) for all Stencil components

The Design tokens are managed using Style Dictionary [Github repository](https://github.com/phantasmagoriadigital/sux-style-dictionary)

## Getting Started - DEVELOPMENT

To get the project running:

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To start development wit StencilJS & Storybook run `start-dev` in the terminal

```bash
npm run start-dev
```

Or run the Stencil and Storybook manually using:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
npm run storybook
```

## Getting Started - CONSUMING COMPONENTS

Substrate is not ready for use in production. Currently you will need to build and manually integrate components to experiment.

Check out our [Substrate DS StoryBook](https://sb.nextds.design) to see they components in their current state.

[ Experiamental ] Use the webcomponent library to play around using unpkg by adding the following to your html head:

```html
<script crossorigin type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/sux-ds@latest/dist/substrate-ds/substrate-ds.esm.js"></script>
```
